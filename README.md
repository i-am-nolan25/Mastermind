# Mastermind Game

## Overview
Mastermind Java Game is an engaging and interactive console-based application inspired by the classic Mastermind board game. It challenges players to test their logic and deduction skills by guessing a secret code within a limited number of attempts. In our latest update, we've introduced three new algorithms: random, minimax, and DFS (Depth-First Search) to enhance the gameplay experience and offer varied strategic approaches for players.

## Key Features üöÄ
- **Code Generation**: The game generates a secret code made up of a sequence of four number pegs for the player to guess.
- **Player Input**: Players enter their guesses through the console, trying to crack the secret code within a specified number of attempts.
- **Feedback System**: After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player, indicating how accurate their guess was. Feedback typically consists of clues, indicating correct pegs in the correct position (represented as *) and correct pegs in the wrong position (represented as +).
- **Limited Attempts**: Players have a limited number of attempts (up to 12 attempts) to guess the correct code, adding an element of strategy and urgency to the gameplay.
- **Random Algorithm**: The game generates a random code for the player to guess.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The game generates a code based on the minimax algorithm for the player to guess.
- **DFS Algorithm**: The game generates a code based on the DFS algorithm for the player to guess.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or later

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/i-am-nolan25/Mastermind.git
